# E-R Model 1

## <u>*Why do we need to learn databases?* </u>
- Database Management System (DBMS) is a tool that allows us to store,
modify, and query data.

### The Entity-Relationship Model
The **E-R** (entity-relationship) data model views the real world as a set of basic **objects** (entities) and **relationships** among these objects. 

- data model views the real world as a set of basic objects (entities) and relationships among these objects. (is very similar to ==Mind Map==)

It is intended primarily for the DB design process by allowing the specification of an **enterprise scheme**. This represents the overall logical structure of the DB. 

- An **entity** is an object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects.
    - *Example*: <span style="color: red;">Michelle Lee with S.S.N. 890-12-3456 is an entity </span>
- An **entity set** is a set of entities of the same type 
    - *Examples*: 
        - All employee hired by Company X
        - Account: All persons having an account at a bank Y

## Entity Set
- We can express the overall logical structure of a database <br> **graphically** with an E-R diagram.

An entity set has **three** components: 
- **Rectangles** representing **name** of the entity set.
- **Ellipses** representing **attributes** of the set
- **Lines** linking attributes to entity sets
#### Example: 
A employee can have a SSN, Name, DoB, Salary 
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 373px">

#### Practice making graph - 
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 373px">

|Name|State|Established|
|----|:-----:|-----------:|
|Yellow Stone|WY|1872|
|Great Smoky Mountain|TN| 1934|
|Acadia|ME|1916|
|Mount Rainer|WA|1899|
</div><br>

<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 373px">

## Entities and Entity Set
- A **relationship** describe relationship between **entities**.
    - <span style="color: red;">A student is **advised** by a professor since Fall 2022 semester </span>
- A relationship set is a set of relationship of the same type
    - <span style="color: red;">Advised: All students advised by some professor in University. </span>

## E-R diagrams Continued
- We can express the overall logical structure of a database <br> **graphically** with an E-R diagram


**Relationship set** has following components:
- **Diamonds** representing **relationship sets**
- **Lines** linking (two or more) entity sets to **relationship sets**.
---
#### Example:
<span style="color: red;"> The “since” attribute in this example is called a descriptive attribute, since it describes the mapping from A to B </span>
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 373px">

# Practice
### Student & Faculty
1. Student is represented by SID, sname, and DoB
2. Student id uniquely identify student
3. A faculty is represented by "SSN", pname, and salary
4. A faculty SSN is uniquely identify faculty
5. A course is represented by CRN, section, and cname
6. A course number can uniquely identify a course
7. A student can be advised by a faculty
8. A faculty can teach a class
9. A student can take a class
