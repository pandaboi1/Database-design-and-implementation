### Weak Entity Set Example
- Consider Entity Set Team, and Player
    - Each Team entity stores a unique Name
    - Each Player entity stores a player Name, a Team Name and Number
    - <span style="color:red">Each Player only join at most one team</span>
    - <span style="color:red">Each Player must join at least one team.</span>
    - <span style="color:red">Note: there can be players with the same number on different teams</span>
- How to design Entity set Team and Player?
    - Consider Entity sets Team, and Player.
    - To simplify the expression… we introduce a new concept: <span style="color:red">Weak Entity Set</span>

### A Special Case
Prereqs for CSCI 4333 are CSCI 3333 and CMPE 3333
How can we describe it in E-R model?
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%">

![A Special Case 1](Images\ERM4\ERM4_4.png) </div>
- Entities sets can be to themselves.


We can annotate the <span style="color: blue">role</span> played by the entities in this case. Suppose that we want to pair a mature student with a novice student...

### Ternary relationships
So far, we have only considered binary relationships 
it is possible to have **higher order** relationships, including **ternary** relationships.

Consider the following example that describes the fact that employees at a bank work in one or more bank branches, and have one or more job descriptions
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%">

![Ternary Relationships 1](Images\ERM4\ERM4_6.png) </div>

Sometimes you have a choice of a single ternary relationship or two binary relationships… 
In general, unless you really need a ternary relationship, use binary relationships. **FACT**: Every ternary (and higher order) relationship can be converted into a set of binary relationships.

### Binary vs. Ternary Relationships
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%">

![Binary vs. Ternary 1](Images\ERM4\ERM4_9.png) </div>

1. Every policy must be owned by some employee.
2. Each policy covers at least one dependent.
3. A policy cannot be owned by two or more employees (one-tomany).
4. A dependent must be matched with some policyid.

### ISA (`is a’) Hierarchies
- As in C++, or other PLs, attributes are inherited.
- If we declare A <span style="color:blue">ISA B</span>, every A entity is also considered to be a B
entity. 

- Reasons for using ISA:
    - To add descriptive attributes specific to a subclass.
    - To identify entities that participate in a relationship.
- <span style="color:blue">Overlap constraints</span>: Can Joe be an Hourly_Emps as well as a Contract_Emps entity?
- <span style="color:blue">Covering constraints</span>: Does every Employees entity also have to be an Hourly_Emps or a Contract_Emps?
<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%">

### ER Design Decisions
- The use of an attribute or entity set to represent an object.
- Whether a real-world concept is best expressed by an entity set or a relationship set.
- The use of a ternary relationship versus a pair of binary
relationships.
- The use of a strong or weak entity set.
- The use of aggregation – can treat the aggregate entity sets as a single unit without concern for the details of its internal structure.
