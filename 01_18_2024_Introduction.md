# Database Design and Implementation

### <u>*Why do we need to learn databases?*
### *Why don't we want to store data in a txt file?*</u>
---
### Databases have:
**Reliable: safety to data**
- Change data
- Backup data


**Support Complex Editing/Retrieving of Data**


**Space Efficient**


**Allow Multiple Users (Editing/Accessing)**
- Reader can only view
- Writers can edit and view


**Organization/Interpablity**
- Improved scalability


**Enforces Constraints**
- Verify inputs


**Query Expressiveness**
- Filters with Sequel


**Concurrency**
- Allows more than one to edit a value
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Prevents conflict actions
---
### Database Users
- End users (or DB application users)
- DB application programmers (more precisely, they are DBMS users)
    - webmasters
- Database Administrator (DBA)
    - Designs logic/physical schemas
    - Handles security and authorization
    - Data availability, crash recovery
    - Database tuning as needs evolve


    **Must understand a DBMS word!**
---
### Data Models
A class of mathematical structures, with **description** and **operations**.
