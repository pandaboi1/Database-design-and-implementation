## Key Constraints 2
### Participation Constraints Cont.
Earlier, we saw an example of a one-to-one key constraint, noting that a man may be married to at most one woman, and a woman may be married to at most one man (both men and women can be unmarried).

*Example*: Suppose we want to build a database for the “<span style="color:red">Springfield Married Persons Association</span>”.
- In this case, <span style="color:red">everyone</span> must be married!
- <span style="color:red">This condition cannot be described by Key Cosntraint</span>
- <span style="color:blue">Participation Constraint (at least one)</span>

Participation constraints are indicated by bold lines in ER Diagrams.

*Example*: In Springfield Married Persons Association, in addition to Key Constraint, we need:
1. A man record always associate with at <span style="color: red">least one</span> woman record.
2. A woman record always associate with at <span style="color: red">least one</span> man record

*Example*: Many people can be born in any country , but any individual is born in at most one country. 
<span style="color: red"> In addition, a country should have at least one person.</span>
1. Should a **person record**  always associate with <span style="color:red">at least on</span> **country record**? No (Haven't Mentioned)
2. Should a **country record** always associate with <span style ="color:red">ar least one</span> **person record**? **<span style ="color:red">Yes</span>**

## Practice Making Key Constraint
<u>**Researcher vs. Project**</u>: *One-to-Many*
1. A reasearcher can participate in many projects
2. A Project can associate with no more than 1 reasearcher
3. A researcher must participate in at least one project
4. A project must associate with at least one researcher
